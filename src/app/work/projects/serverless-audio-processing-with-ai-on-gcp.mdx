## Overview

Imagine uploading an audio file and receiving a polished transcript and concise summary in seconds—no servers, no hassle. This project brings that vision to life with a **serverless AI-powered pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. From transcription to summarization, every step is automated, enabling users to focus on insights rather than infrastructure.

---

## Key Features

* **Effortless audio-to-text transformation**: Upload audio files and instantly receive transcripts and summaries.
* **Serverless magic**: A fully automated architecture that scales seamlessly without manual intervention.
* **AI-driven intelligence**: Leverages Deepgram for precise transcription and Gemini for insightful summarization.
* **Dynamic user experience**: Real-time updates via a Flutter-powered frontend connected to Firebase.
* **Secure and organized processing**: Metadata-driven access control ensures user data is handled safely and efficiently.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: Flutter for a sleek UI, Firebase Auth for authentication, Firebase Storage for uploads, and Firestore for real-time data.
* **Backend**:

  * Google Cloud Functions (Python) for event-driven processing
  * Google Cloud Storage for file triggers
  * Firestore for structured data storage
  * Deepgram API for transcription
  * Gemini via Vertex AI for summarization
* **Dev Tools**: Firebase CLI, GCP SDK, Python SDKs (`google-cloud`, `deepgram`, `vertexai`)

---

## Challenges and Insights

* **Mastering event-driven workflows**: Debugging GCS-triggered functions and parsing metadata required creative problem-solving.
* **Securing integrations**: Implemented signed URLs and authenticated API calls to safeguard sensitive data.
* **Balancing cost and performance**: Fine-tuned LLM configurations to optimize output quality while managing API expenses.
* **Scalable Firestore design**: Built user-specific subcollections for efficient and secure data storage.
