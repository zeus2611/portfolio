## Overview

BridgeTalk transforms exam preparation with an AI-powered platform that simulates real interview scenarios for TOEFL and IELTS candidates [memory:6]. Users interact with dynamic video avatars, receive real-time transcription of their responses, and get personalized assessments powered by GPT—all through a seamless mobile and web experience. As the backend architect, I engineered a dual-architecture system supporting both B2B (institutions) and B2C (individual learners) use cases across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Key Features

* **Realistic exam simulation**: Interactive video avatars and cue cards that mirror actual TOEFL/IELTS speaking test formats
* **Real-time audio processing**: Asynchronous transcription pipeline that processes user responses while they continue with subsequent questions
* **Intelligent assessment engine**: Context-aware GPT-powered evaluations that provide personalized feedback based on question types and user performance
* **Dual architecture design**: Separate B2B (Appwrite) and B2C (Firebase) backends optimized for institutional and individual user needs
* **Cross-platform availability**: Production apps on Google Play Store, Apple App Store, plus web dashboard for B2B instructors

---

## Technology Stack

* **Backend**:
  * FastAPI (Python) for REST API endpoints
  * Appwrite (B2B): Database, authentication, and storage for institutional deployments
  * Firebase (B2C): Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Storage for individual users
  * Deepgram API for real-time speech-to-text transcription
  * OpenAI GPT for assessment generation with custom evaluation prompts
  * Google Cloud Platform for cloud infrastructure

* **Frontend Integration**: Flutter (iOS, Android, web) with REST API integration
* **Infrastructure**: Multi-region deployment supporting concurrent exam sessions

---

## Architecture Highlights

* **Session management system**: Implemented chat-based conversation threading that groups related questions, enabling contextual assessment across multi-part exams
* **Asynchronous processing pipeline**: Decoupled audio transcription from user interaction flow—responses process in background while users advance to next questions
* **Dual BaaS strategy**: Architected separate backend implementations (Appwrite for B2B, Firebase for B2C) to optimize for different scaling and feature requirements
* **API design**: Built RESTful endpoints for exam selection, question fetching, audio upload, transcription retrieval, and assessment generation
* **Real-time data flow**: Engineered request/response cycle from audio capture → Cloud Storage → Deepgram transcription → Firestore/Appwrite storage → GPT assessment

---

## Challenges and Insights

* **Managing real-time constraints**: Designed asynchronous workflows to prevent transcription latency from blocking user progress through exam sections
* **Integrating multiple AI services**: Orchestrated Deepgram and GPT APIs with proper error handling, retry logic, and cost optimization strategies
* **Dual architecture complexity**: Maintained feature parity across Appwrite and Firebase backends while adapting to each platform's unique SDK patterns
* **Context preservation**: Implemented chat ID-based threading to maintain conversation history for accurate, holistic assessments across multi-question sessions
* **Cross-platform API consistency**: Ensured seamless frontend integration across iOS, Android, and web clients with unified API contracts

---

## Impact

* Delivered production-ready platform serving users across iOS, Android, and web simultaneously
* Enabled B2B institutions to manage student cohorts through dedicated instructor dashboard
* Automated assessment workflow that provides instant, personalized feedback—eliminating hours of manual evaluation
* Architected scalable backend capable of handling concurrent exam sessions with real-time audio processing
* Gained deep expertise in multi-cloud architecture, AI API integration, and production mobile backend development
